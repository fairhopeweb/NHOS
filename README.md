## Detailed setup guide
### Prerequisites
There are no special prerequisites required to start using NiceHash OS.

### Concepts
NiceHash OS is an **operating system** which loads from **USB flash drive** and **runs from computer memory**. It contains **all the tools and drivers needed** to bring your mining machine to life.

NiceHash OS flash drive is divided into two partitions, **`SYSTEM`** and **`NHOS`**. `SYSTEM` partition contains bootloader, Linux kernel and [RAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory "Random Access Memory") file system, while `NHOS` partition contains NiceHash OS configuration file.

### Creating NiceHash OS flash drive
There are two steps required to create a fully functional NiceHash OS flash drive
1) **Create a USB flash** drive **containing an operating system**. Detailed instructions are available on [How to create NiceHash OS flash drive](nhos_create_flash_drive.md) page.
2) **Update NiceHash OS configuration file with your data**. Detailed instructions are available on [How to configure NiceHash OS](nhos_configuration.md) page.

**Note**<br/>
This is a guide on how to prepare **one** NiceHash OS flash drive. If you plan to use the same setup on **multiple** machines then you can do the following. Go through the steps mentioned above for each NiceHash OS flash drives you need. After this, you will have multiple NiceHash OS flash drives which contain a **invalid** (empty) configuration. Now use **valid** configuration from your initial NiceHash OS flash drive and copy it to all newly created NiceHash OS drives.
<br/><br/>
## Finish
At this point you should have everything prepared to start using NiceHash OS. All you need to do now is to **plug in NiceHash OS flash drive in to your mining machine and turn it on!**
