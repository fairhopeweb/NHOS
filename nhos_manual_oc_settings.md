# Manual OC settings (advanced)

You can apply overclocking (OC) settings by manually changing the parameters in the **_device_settings.json_** file. This file is generated after the first successful boot on your mining rig and is saved on NiceHash OS bootable USB flash drive.  After that you can open _device_settings.json_ file and change power (TDP) settings, core and memory clocks for every device and algorithm separately.

```json
tdp: "default"
core_clocks: "default"
memory_clocks: "default"
```

## TDP (valid for both NVIDIA and AMD)
TDP is set as a percentage parameter for both NVIDIA and AMD graphics cards. If you want to change TDP you have to change the ```“default”``` value.

For example, if you want to set TDP to 85% then you have to change this value to ```"tdp": 85```.

For example, if you want to set TDP to 110%, then you have to change this value to ```"tdp": 110```.

## Core_clocks & memory_clocks (NVIDIA)
If you want to change core and memory clocks for **NVIDIA graphics cards** you have to change the ```“default”``` value. Value is relative to card default value.

For example, if you want to raise your core or memory clock for 50 Hz then you have to change this value to ```"core_clocks": 50``` or ```"memory_clocks": 50```.

For example, if you want to lower your core or memory clock for 50 Hz then you have to change this value to ```"core_clocks": -50``` or ```"memory_clocks": -50```.

## Core_clocks & memory_clocks (AMD)
If you want to change core and memory clocks for **AMD graphics cards** you have to change the ```“default”``` value. Values for AMD cards are absolute.

For example, if you want to raise your core or memory clock from 1800 to 1850 Hz then you have change this value to ```"core_clocks": 1850``` or ```"memory_clocks": 1850```.

For example, if you want to lower your core or memory clock from 1800 to 1750 Hz then you have change this value to ```"core_clocks": 1750``` or ```"memory_clocks": 1750```.
